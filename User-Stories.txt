3. USER STORIES (For Hospital Information System)
Definition and Format

A user story describes a requirement from the perspective of the end user. It follows a simple structure:

As a [type of user/role], I want [goal or capability], so that [value or benefit].

This structure clearly identifies:
• Who needs the feature
• What they need
• Why they need it

User stories keep the development focused on real hospital workflows and ensure every feature supports clinical or administrative value.

Examples of User Stories (HIS):

As a doctor, I want to view a patient’s complete medical history, so that I can make accurate diagnoses.

As a nurse, I want to update patient vital signs in real time, so that the medical team has the latest information.

As a receptionist, I want to register new patients quickly, so that the admission process is smooth and efficient.

As a pharmacist, I want to check medication stock levels, so that I can dispense prescriptions without delays or shortages.

As a lab technician, I want to upload and verify test results, so that doctors can review them immediately.

As a radiologist, I want to attach imaging reports to the patient file, so that doctors can access them for treatment decisions.

As a patient, I want to view my upcoming appointments, so that I can manage my hospital visits easily.

As an insurance officer, I want to confirm the patient’s insurance validity, so that claims can be processed correctly.

As a doctor, I want to prescribe medications electronically, so that the pharmacy receives accurate and clear orders.

As a nurse, I want to receive alerts for medication administration times, so that I can provide timely care.

As an administrator, I want to generate daily and monthly reports, so that I can evaluate hospital performance.

As a billing officer, I want to calculate patient charges automatically, so that invoices are accurate and error-free.

As a patient, I want to receive appointment reminders, so that I don’t miss scheduled visits.

As a ward supervisor, I want to see bed availability in real time, so that patients can be assigned rooms efficiently.

As an IT manager, I want to control user access levels, so that sensitive data is protected and only authorized staff can access it.
