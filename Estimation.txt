4. WEIGHTING AND ESTIMATION (For Hospital Information System)
Purpose of Story Estimation

Estimation helps the team understand how big a user story is, how much effort it needs, and how to plan sprints effectively. It allows the team to decide how many stories can fit into a sprint and compare the size of one story to another.

Why Story Points Instead of Hours?

Story points measure relative complexity, not exact time.
People are much better at comparing tasks than predicting exact hours.

Examples:
• “Updating patient vitals is simpler than generating hospital reports.”
• “Building the pharmacy stock system is about twice as complex as building the appointment calendar.”

This avoids incorrect hour-based commitments and focuses on effort, risk, and complexity.

Story Point Scale (Modified Fibonacci Sequence)

Development teams often use the Fibonacci sequence because it reflects natural jumps in complexity:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100

Smaller numbers = simple tasks
Larger numbers = complex, risky, unclear tasks

What Contributes to Story Point Size?

When estimating a hospital system feature, consider:

• Complexity – How difficult is the logic? Example: EMR access levels
• Amount of work – How many steps or screens are needed?
• Technical uncertainty – Unknown integrations like lab devices or insurance portals
• Risks or dependencies – Legal rules, patient safety requirements, or data privacy concerns
