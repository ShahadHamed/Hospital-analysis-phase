2. PRODUCT BACKLOG DEVELOPMENT (For Hospital Information System)
1. Definition and Purpose

A product backlog is a prioritized list of all features, enhancements, fixes, and tasks needed to develop the Hospital Information System. It guides the development team and ensures the highest-value healthcare features are delivered first. It remains dynamic and changes as hospital needs evolve.

2. Backlog Prioritization Techniques

Backlog items are ordered based on value and urgency. Techniques include:

• Value vs. Effort – High-value, low-effort hospital features (e.g., appointment reminders) are done first.
• MoSCoW Method – Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have.
• Risk-based prioritization – Critical patient-safety features (e.g., medication alerts) are prioritized.
• Business impact – Features that improve efficiency and reduce hospital workload are moved higher.
